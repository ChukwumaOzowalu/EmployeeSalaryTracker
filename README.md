Employee Management Program
This program allows users to create a list of employees with their respective information such as name, ID number, department, job title, and initial salary. It then provides the option to adjust each employee's salary. The program utilizes an employeeObject module to create and manipulate employee objects.

Instructions
Run the program.
Enter the number of employees you want to add to the list.
For each employee, enter their name, ID number, department, job title, and initial salary.
After adding all employees, you will be prompted to adjust each employee's salary. Enter the amount to increase or decrease the salary (use negative values for decreases).
Once all adjustments are made, the program will display the final list of employees with their updated salaries.
Note
If you encounter a value error (e.g., entering a non-numeric value where a number is expected), the program will prompt you to restart.
Ensure all input values are correctly formatted to prevent errors.
